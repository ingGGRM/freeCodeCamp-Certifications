            <p>Sun, star around which Earth and the other components of the solar system revolve. It is the dominant body of the system, constituting more than 99 percent of its entire mass. The Sun is the source of an enormous amount of energy, a portion of which provides Earth with the light and heat necessary to support life</p>
            <p>The Sun is classified as a G2 V star, with G2 standing for the second hottest stars of the yellow G class—of surface temperature about 5,800 kelvins (K)—and the V representing a main sequence, or dwarf, star, the typical star for this temperature class. (G stars are so called because of the prominence of a band of atomic and molecular spectral lines that the German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer designated G.) The Sun exists in the outer part of the Milky Way Galaxy and was formed from material that had been processed inside a supernova. The Sun is not, as is often said, a small star. Although it falls midway between the biggest and smallest stars of its type, there are so many dwarf stars that the Sun falls in the top 5 percent of stars in the neighbourhood that immediately surrounds it.</p>

            <p>The radius of the Sun, R☉, is 109 times that of Earth, but its distance from Earth is 215 R☉, so it subtends an angle of only 1/2° in the sky, roughly the same as that of the Moon. By comparison, Proxima Centauri, the next closest star to Earth, is 250,000 times farther away, and its relative apparent brightness is reduced by the square of that ratio, or 62 billion times. The temperature of the Sun’s surface is so high that no solid or liquid can exist there; the constituent materials are predominantly gaseous atoms, with a very small number of molecules. As a result, there is no fixed surface. The surface viewed from Earth, called the photosphere, is the layer from which most of the radiation reaches us; the radiation from below is absorbed and reradiated, and the emission from overlying layers drops sharply, by about a factor of six every 200 kilometres (124 miles). The Sun is so far from Earth that this slightly fuzzy surface cannot be resolved, and so the limb (the visible edge) appears sharp.</p>

            <p>The mass of the Sun, M☉, is 743 times the total mass of all the planets in the solar system and 330,000 times that of Earth. All the interesting planetary and interplanetary gravitational phenomena are negligible effects in comparison to the force exerted by the Sun. Under the force of gravity, the great mass of the Sun presses inward, and to keep the star from collapsing, the central pressure outward must be great enough to support its weight. The density at the Sun’s core is about 100 times that of water (roughly six times that at the centre of Earth), but the temperature is at least 15,000,000 K, so the central pressure is at least 10,000 times greater than that at the centre of Earth, which is 3,500 kilobars. The nuclei of atoms are completely stripped of their electrons, and at this high temperature they collide to produce the nuclear reactions that are responsible for generating the energy vital to life on Earth.</p>
            <p>While the temperature of the Sun drops from 15,000,000 K at the centre to 5,800 K at the photosphere, a surprising reversal occurs above that point; the temperature drops to a minimum of 4,000 K, then begins to rise in the chromosphere, a layer about 7,000 kilometres high at a temperature of 8,000 K. During a total eclipse the chromosphere appears as a pink ring. Above the chromosphere is a dim, extended halo called the corona, which has a temperature of 1,000,000 K and reaches far past the planets. Beyond a distance of 5R☉ from the Sun, the corona flows outward at a speed (near Earth) of 400 kilometres per second (km/s); this flow of charged particles is called the solar wind.</p>
            <p>The Sun is a very stable source of energy; its radiative output, called the solar constant, is 1.366 kilowatts per square metre at Earth and varies by no more than 0.1 percent. Superposed on this stable star, however, is an interesting 11-year cycle of magnetic activity manifested by regions of transient strong magnetic fields called sunspots.</p>

            <p>The energy radiated by the Sun is produced during the conversion of hydrogen (H) atoms to helium (He). The Sun is at least 90 percent hydrogen by number of atoms, so the fuel is readily available. Since one hydrogen atom weighs 1.0078 atomic mass units and a single helium atom weighs 4.0026, the conversion of four hydrogen atoms to one helium atom yields 0.0294 mass unit, which are all converted to energy, 6.8 million electron volts (MeV, 1 MeV = 1.6 × 10−6 erg), in the form of gamma (γ) rays or the kinetic energy of the products. If all the hydrogen is converted, 0.7 percent of the mass becomes energy, according to the Einstein formula E = mc2, in which E represents the energy, m is the mass, and c is the speed of light. A calculation of the time required to convert all the hydrogen in the Sun provides an estimate of the length of time for which the Sun can continue to radiate energy. In only about 10 percent of the Sun are the temperatures high enough to sustain fusion reactions. Converting 0.7 percent of the 2 × 1032 grams of hydrogen into energy that is radiated at 4 × 1033 ergs per second permits the Sun to shine for 3 × 1017 seconds, or 10 billion years at the present rate.</p>
            <p>The process of energy generation results from the enormous pressure and density at the centre of the Sun, which makes it possible for nuclei to overcome electrostatic repulsion. (Nuclei are positive and thus repel each other.) Once in some billions of years a given proton (1H, in which the superscript represents the mass of the isotope) is close enough to another to undergo a process called inverse beta decay, in which one proton becomes a neutron and combines with the second to form a deuteron (2D). This is shown symbolically on the first line of equation 1, in which e− is an electron and ν is a subatomic particle known as a neutrino.</p>
            <code><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/76/14276-004-B173F395/Equation-energy-neutrino-hydrogen-atoms.jpg"></code>
            <p>Equation 1 shows that for every two hydrogen atoms converted, one neutrino of average energy 0.26 MeV carrying 1.3 percent of the total energy released is produced.</p>
            <p>While this is a rare event, hydrogen atoms are so numerous that it is the main solar energy source. Subsequent encounters (listed on the second and third lines) proceed much faster: the deuteron encounters one of the ubiquitous protons to produce helium-3 (3He), and these in turn form helium-4 (4He). The net result is that four hydrogen atoms are fused into one helium atom. The energy is carried off by gamma-ray photons (γ) and neutrinos, ν. Because the nuclei must have enough energy to overcome the electrostatic barrier, the rate of energy production varies as the fourth power of the temperature.</p>

            <p>Although there are no fires on the surface of the Sun, the photosphere seethes and roils, displaying the effects of the underlying convection. Photons flowing from below, trapped by the underlying layers, finally escape. This produces a dramatic drop in temperature and density. The temperature at the visible surface is about 5,800 K but drops to a minimum about 4,000 K at approximately 500 kilometres above the photosphere. The density, about 10−7 gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3), drops a factor of 2.7 every 150 kilometres. The solar atmosphere is actually a vacuum by most standards; the total density above any square centimetre is about 1 gram, about 1,000 times less than the comparable mass in the atmosphere of Earth. One can see through the atmosphere of Earth but not through that of the Sun because the former is shallow, and the molecules absorb only radiation that lies outside of the visible spectrum. The hot photosphere of the Sun, by contrast, contains an ion called negative hydrogen, H−, a hydrogen nucleus with two electrons attached. The H− ion absorbs radiation voraciously through most of the spectrum.</p>
            <p>The photosphere is the portion of the Sun seen in ordinary light. Its image reveals two dominant features, a darkening toward the outermost regions, called limb darkening, and a fine rice-grain-like structure called granulation. The darkening occurs simply because the temperature is falling; when one looks at the edge of the Sun, one sees light from higher, cooler, and darker layers. The granules are convective cells that bring energy up from below. Each cell measures about 1,500 kilometres across. Granules have a lifetime of about 25 minutes, during which hot gas rises within them at speeds of about 300 metres per second. They then break up, either by fading out or by exploding into an expanding ring of granules. The granules occur all over the Sun. It is believed that the explosion pattern shapes the surrounding granules in a pattern called mesogranulation, although the existence of that pattern is in dispute. A larger, undisputed pattern called supergranulation is a network of outward velocity flows, each about 30,000 kilometres across, which is probably tied to the big convective zone rather than to the relatively small granules. The flow concentrates the surface magnetic fields to the supergranulation-cell boundaries, creating a network of magnetic-field elements.</p>
            <p>The photospheric magnetic fields extend up into the atmosphere, where the supergranular pattern dominates the conducting gas. While the temperature above the average surface areas continues to drop, it does not fall as rapidly as at the network edges, and a picture of the Sun at a wavelength absorbed somewhat above the surface shows the network edges to be bright. This occurs throughout the ultraviolet.</p>
            <p>Fraunhofer was the first to observe the solar spectrum, finding emission in all colours with many dark lines at certain wavelengths. He assigned letters to these lines, by which some are still known, such as the D-lines of sodium, the G-band, and the K-lines of ionized calcium. But it was the German physicist Gustav R. Kirchhoff who explained the meaning of the lines, explaining that the dark lines formed in cooler upper layers, absorbing the light emerging from below. By comparing these lines with laboratory data, we can identify the elements responsible and their state of ionization and excitation.</p>

            <p>A wonderful rhythm in the ebb and flow of sunspot activity dominates the atmosphere of the Sun. Sunspots, the largest of which can be seen even without a telescope, are regions of extremely strong magnetic field found on the Sun’s surface. A typical mature sunspot is seen in white light to have roughly the form of a daisy. It consists of a dark central core, the umbra, where the magnetic flux loop emerges vertically from below, surrounded by a less-dark ring of fibrils called the penumbra, where the magnetic field spreads outward horizontally.</p>
            <p>George Ellery Hale observed the sunspot spectrum in the early 20th century with his new solar telescope and found it similar to that of cool red M-type stars observed with his new stellar telescope. Thus, he showed that the umbra appears dark because it is quite cool, only about 3,000 K, as compared with the 5,800 K temperature of the surrounding photosphere. The spot pressure, consisting of magnetic and gas pressure, must balance the pressure of its surroundings; hence the spot must somehow cool until the inside gas pressure is considerably lower than that of the outside. Owing to the great magnetic energy present in sunspots, regions near the cool spots actually have the hottest and most intense activity. Sunspots are thought to be cooled by the suppression of their strong fields with the convective motions bringing heat from below. For this reason, there appears to be a lower limit on the size of the spots of approximately 500 kilometres. Smaller ones are rapidly heated by radiation from the surroundings and destroyed.</p>
            <p>Although the magnetic field suppresses convection and random motions are much lower than in the surroundings, a wide variety of organized motions occur in spots, mostly in the penumbra, where the horizontal field lines permit detectable horizontal flows. One such motion is the Evershed effect, an outward flow at a rate of one kilometre per second in the outer half of the penumbra that extends beyond the penumbra in the form of moving magnetic features. These features are elements of the magnetic field that flow outward across the area surrounding the spot. In the chromosphere above a sunspot, a reverse Evershed flow appears as material spirals into the spot; the inner half of the penumbra flows inward to the umbra.</p>
            <p>Oscillations are observed in sunspots as well. When a section of the photosphere known as a light bridge crosses the umbra, rapid horizontal flow is seen. Although the umbral field is too strong to permit motion, rapid oscillations called umbral flashes appear in the chromosphere just above, with a 150-second period. In the chromosphere above the penumbra, so-called running waves are observed to travel radially outward with a 300-second period.</p>
